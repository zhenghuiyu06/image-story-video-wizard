# Project state contract

`PROJECT_STATE.json` is the single source for workflow position. It is not a log of secrets or a substitute for the actual artifacts.

## Required top-level fields

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "project_id": "slug-or-uuid",
  "title": "Human-readable title",
  "project_root": "/absolute/project/path",
  "host": {
    "name": "codex|workbuddy|other",
    "capabilities": {
      "local_files": true,
      "model_routing": false,
      "logged_in_browser": false,
      "tts": false,
      "image_generation": false,
      "hyperframes": false,
      "render": false
    }
  },
  "current_stage": "START",
  "stage_status": "进行中",
  "pending_request": "Confirm project root and whether this is new or resumed work.",
  "next_stage": "BRIEF",
  "decisions": {},
  "artifacts": {},
  "stage_history": [],
  "created_at": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "updated_at": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
}
```

## Allowed stages

`START`, `BRIEF`, `BENCHMARKS`, `WRITING_PACK`, `SCRIPT`, `VOICE`, `STORYBOARD`, `VISUAL_STYLE`, `CHARACTER_ANCHORS`, `IMAGE_PROMPTS`, `IMAGE_GENERATION`, `ASSET_QC`, `MUSIC`, `PREVIEW`, `FINAL_RENDER`, `FEEDBACK`.

## Allowed statuses

`未开始`, `进行中`, `待确认`, `已确认`, `需要返工`, `已跳过`.

## Update rules

1. Update state after creating a material artifact, reaching a gate, receiving a gate decision, or changing hosts.
2. Before entering a stage, append the prior stage result to `stage_history` with timestamp and artifact paths.
3. `pending_request` must name the one current user action. It must not contain the full future checklist.
4. Store decisions as facts with source and status, for example:

```json
"decisions": {
  "aspect_ratio": {
    "value": "16:9",
    "source": "user",
    "status": "已确认"
  }
}
```

For a confirmed City Archives project, persist the reusable production decisions rather than relying on chat history:

```json
"decisions": {
  "production_profile": {"value": "city-archives-v1", "source": "user", "status": "已确认"},
  "image_generation_mode": {"value": "assistant", "source": "user", "status": "已确认"},
  "image_batch_size": {"value": 10, "source": "city-archives-v1", "status": "已确认"},
  "image_batch_qc": {"value": "automatic", "source": "city-archives-v1", "status": "已确认"},
  "critical_retry_limit": {"value": 1, "source": "city-archives-v1", "status": "已确认"},
  "final_delivery": {"value": "master-only-downloads", "source": "city-archives-v1", "status": "已确认"}
}
```

5. Artifact paths must be absolute inside `PROJECT_STATE.json`. Public deliverables must not expose private paths.
6. Never store plaintext API keys, cookies, login URLs, redemption codes, or tokens.
7. When returning to an earlier stage, do not delete downstream artifacts. Mark them in `artifacts` as `stale: true` until regenerated or re-confirmed.

## Resume behavior

On resume:

1. Validate the state file with `scripts/project_state.py validate`.
2. Confirm that the latest required artifact still exists.
3. Tell the user the latest confirmed gate and the single pending request.
4. Continue from `current_stage`; do not repeat already confirmed questions.

## Delivery status mapping

- No material artifact: `未做`.
- Artifact exists but user has not accepted the relevant gate: `已做待验`.
- User accepted the final master: `已验收`.
