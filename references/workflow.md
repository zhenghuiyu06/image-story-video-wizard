# Guided workflow contracts

Use only the current stage section in user-facing interaction. The full sequence belongs to the Skill, not to the user.

Each stage has five fields:

- **Enter when:** required prior gate.
- **Skill acts:** work performed without asking the user to manage it.
- **Ask now:** only the minimum current input.
- **Deliver:** artifact that proves the stage work happened.
- **Gate:** explicit approval required before transition.

## START

**Enter when:** the Skill is invoked.

**Skill acts:** locate or initialize `PROJECT_STATE.json`; inspect only the supplied project scope; identify host capabilities and existing artifacts; classify new versus resumed work.

**Ask now:** if undiscoverable, ask for the project folder and whether this is new or continued work. Do not ask production questions yet.

**Deliver:** current-state summary, confirmed host, missing capability list, and first actionable request.

**Gate:** project root and resume point are correct.

## BRIEF

**Enter when:** START is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** turn the user's idea into a production brief: topic, audience, audio-first versus visual-first, platform, aspect ratio, target duration, language, narrator count, release scope, and what success means for this sample.

**Ask now:** ask at most three questions. Prefer: topic/audience, target platform/format, desired duration. Infer reversible defaults and show them for confirmation.

**Deliver:** `BRIEF.md` using `assets/brief-template.md`.

**Gate:** user confirms the brief. Channel creation, upload, or publishing is not included unless separately authorized.

## BENCHMARKS

**Enter when:** BRIEF is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** obtain two to five relevant benchmark links, transcripts, or files; assign each a role such as product/business model, script and voice, visual style, or negative example. If the user has none, offer a bounded read-only research pass rather than asking them to solve discovery alone.

**Ask now:** request the benchmark materials or authorization for read-only research. Then ask which observed qualities the user actually wants to learn.

**Deliver:** `BENCHMARKS.md` with role, evidence, learn/avoid decisions, and rights boundary.

**Gate:** user confirms benchmark roles. Learning never means copying exact wording, images, audio, or finished footage.

## WRITING_PACK

**Enter when:** BENCHMARKS is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** build a self-contained `writing-pack/` containing the current assignment, researched materials, benchmark samples, extracted structure and voice rules, length target, interaction rules, and a one-pass/no-padding instruction. Research retains sources; the writer sees only the attribution needed in the final script.

**Ask now:** ask only for source material that cannot be found in scope and one decision about the desired benchmark emphasis.

**Deliver:** writing-pack manifest and archive. Do not expose secrets or internal paths in public-facing materials.

**Gate:** user confirms the package direction, not every line of source material.

## SCRIPT

**Enter when:** WRITING_PACK is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** route the package to the available writing model. WorkBuddy/Kimi K3 is a preferred route when verified; otherwise use an available writer without falsely claiming Kimi participated. Require one complete draft. Return the draft to the guiding host for one focused review using add/delete/local-repair instructions.

**Ask now:** after the draft exists, ask the user to mark specific disliked passages or confirm the whole script. Do not ask the user to redesign the workflow.

**Deliver:** `SCRIPT.md`, estimated narration length, and a short unresolved-facts list if needed.

**Gate:** final script is `已确认`. If the draft is hollow or badly short, mark `需要返工`, repair WRITING_PACK, and start a fresh writing conversation. Do not perform second-round padding.

## VOICE

**Enter when:** SCRIPT is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** check whether a chosen TTS service is locally configured. If access is missing, guide the user through the current official application and local configuration path, verifying the official instructions when they may have changed; never request the plaintext key. For the established Doubao path, use current Seed-TTS 2.0 rather than a legacy generation. Select a representative approximately twenty-second sample and generate five to ten same-text voice auditions. After voice selection, generate a small set of rate auditions.

**Ask now:** first ask whether access is configured, without requesting plaintext credentials. Then ask the user to choose the best voice; only after that ask for rate preference.

**Deliver:** voice audition set, confirmed voice/rate record, final narration, and sentence- or word-level timestamps when available.

**Gate:** user confirms voice and full narration. Do not treat model or parameter suggestions as acceptance.

## STORYBOARD

**Enter when:** VOICE is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** use actual narration duration and timestamps to calculate image cadence and create `STORYBOARD.csv`. Each row includes shot ID, audio start/end, narration excerpt, visual intent, characters, text-card need, and status.

**Ask now:** present two concrete cadence options with real counts. Recommended default for a first audio-first project is 10–12 seconds per image; offer 6–8 seconds when the user wants faster visual motion and accepts more images.

**Deliver:** complete storyboard and count summary.

**Gate:** user confirms cadence, image count, and representative storyboard sections.

## VISUAL_STYLE

**Enter when:** STORYBOARD is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** request one to three reference images or propose two to three directions derived from the brief and benchmarks. Extract stable style variables: medium, palette, line/texture, lighting, composition, aspect ratio, negative constraints, subtitle style, and text-card style. Produce three to five pilot prompts or images.

**Ask now:** ask the user to choose or reject the pilot. Ask one targeted follow-up about the largest visible problem when rejected.

**Deliver:** `VISUAL_STYLE.md`, chosen pilot images, and frozen text treatment.

**Gate:** user explicitly confirms image style and text treatment. Do not write the full image prompt manifest before this.

## CHARACTER_ANCHORS

**Enter when:** VISUAL_STYLE is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** detect recurring characters and decide whether strict identity continuity is needed. For each strict character, create a face anchor and full-body anchor with age, body, clothing, footwear, and era details. Skip this stage for scenery-only or non-recurring characters.

**Ask now:** ask the user to approve or adjust each main character's identity, not every incidental character.

**Deliver:** `characters/` anchor images and character cards.

**Gate:** required anchors are confirmed, or the stage is explicitly `已跳过`.

## IMAGE_PROMPTS

**Enter when:** VISUAL_STYLE and any required CHARACTER_ANCHORS are confirmed.

**Skill acts:** create `IMAGE_PROMPTS.md` mapped one-to-one to storyboard IDs. Each prompt carries reference rules, identity constraints, frozen style, specific scene, composition, output format, and negative constraints. Start with a three-to-five-shot pilot manifest.

**Ask now:** tell the user exactly which pilot prompts to run, where to run them, how to name results, and what to return for review.

**Deliver:** pilot prompt manifest, then full manifest only after pilot approval.

**Gate:** pilot prompts produce acceptable results before full prompt expansion.

## IMAGE_GENERATION

**Enter when:** pilot prompts are confirmed.

**Skill acts:** route to manual or assistant-generated mode. In manual ChatGPT mode, default to one prompt and one image per fresh conversation, issue manageable batches, and map each result to its shot ID. In assistant-generated mode, explain the estimated count and any material cost, verify authorization, run the confirmed pilot, then generate with the available image tool. Do not invoke video-generation models for this slideshow assembly stage.

For confirmed `city-archives-v1` projects, pilot approval plus authorization for autonomous production covers the planned image count and at most one critical-error retry per image. Use `scripts/image_batch_plan.py STORYBOARD.csv --size 10` to produce deterministic batches. Generate one image per call with the complete prompt, save by shot ID rather than response order, review each batch, write `review/IMAGE_BATCH_NN_QC.md`, update `images/GENERATION_LEDGER.md`, and continue to the next batch without a user pause. Move failed originals to `images/revisions/`. After one retry, record any remaining critical issue for final human judgment rather than retrying indefinitely.

**Ask now:** ask the user to choose manual versus assistant-generated mode only when no production profile has already fixed that decision. For logged-in browser work, confirm the correct account and allowed read/write boundary.

**Deliver:** numbered generated images and generation ledger with failures or retries.

**Gate:** all required images exist or missing shots are explicitly accepted.

## ASSET_QC

**Enter when:** the image batch is complete enough to inspect.

**Skill acts:** check counts, IDs, dimensions, corrupt files, narration fit, style drift, repeated composition, identity drift, geographic and era violations, subtitle-safe composition, embedded borders, and text baked into images. Generate a replacement list rather than silently accepting weak assets. Batch QC does not replace this final whole-set check.

**Ask now:** for autonomous `city-archives-v1` production, wait until all batches and the whole-set check are complete, then show only unresolved replacement candidates and reasons. Ask the user to approve replacements or accept specific exceptions.

**Deliver:** frozen image manifest and `review/image-qc.md`.

**Gate:** image set is confirmed for assembly.

## MUSIC

**Enter when:** ASSET_QC is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** ask whether music is needed. If no, mark `已跳过`. If yes, generate or source two to three short audition candidates within the authorized tool path, then plan a low-presence bed or a few emotion components. Narration remains dominant.

**Ask now:** ask whether to skip music; if not, ask the user to choose from auditions.

**Deliver:** music choice and mix plan.

**Gate:** music is confirmed or explicitly skipped.

## PREVIEW

**Enter when:** images are confirmed and music is confirmed or skipped.

**Skill acts:** assemble the project, preferably with HyperFrames when available. In a host with the bundled HyperFrames skills, load the `hyperframes` mandatory entry point before touching the composition and follow its routing instructions. Align images, subtitles, text cards, and music to narration timestamps. Run structural checks and create a reviewable preview. Do not final-render yet.

**Ask now:** tell the user what to review: opening minute, chapter transitions, character first appearances, text/subtitle collisions, and ending. Ask for specific changes or approval.

**Deliver:** preview, review board or representative frames, and issue list.

**Gate:** user approves preview. A general earlier “go ahead” is not sufficient.

## FINAL_RENDER

**Enter when:** PREVIEW is confirmed.

**Skill acts:** render the master, validate container/audio/video properties, extract representative frames from the final file, and watch or request a full human watch. Preserve the editable project.

**Ask now:** ask for acceptance after presenting the actual master and checks. Do not publish automatically.

**Deliver:** master video, project files, check report, and delivery note.

**Gate:** status is `已做待验` until the user accepts; then set `已验收`.

## FEEDBACK

**Enter when:** the user later provides real platform results.

**Skill acts:** record actual production time, manual intervention, playback/retention/feedback data, and identify the smallest workflow change for the next episode. For a new account with 7–15 days of weak results, review topic choice and script first, then present an evidence-based choice between changing the niche and repairing those inputs. After three to five stable, accepted scripts exist, offer to extract the channel's own writing template or Skill. Do not infer performance from render success or freeze a channel template from one sample.

**Ask now:** request only the available real results and the user's qualitative judgment.

**Deliver:** next-episode change list and project-level defaults worth freezing after several episodes.

**Gate:** no final gate; the next project starts from confirmed defaults rather than copying unverified assumptions.
